Preliminary data analysis:
--------
- Data dependencies from [wikipedia-map-reduce](http://code.google.com/p/wikipedia-map-reduce/)
- Requires Wikipedia diffs generated by wmr.wmf.WmfDiffCreator (see shilad)


Data transformation
--------
- Wikipedia reverts generated by wmr.reverts.RevertGraphGenerator
- s3cmd get s3://macalester/wikipedia/reverts/part-r*
- Cat these together into dat/reverts.txt
- Run data_prep/filter_reverts.py to create statistics and filtered reverts file.


Article clustering
--------
- Requires macademia joined data files (located in s3://macademia/nbrvz/joined, created by tfidf package in wikipedia map reduce)
- Download data files (see command at bottom of http://code.google.com/p/macademia/wiki/WikipediaMinner_Hadoop)
- Translate data files into svmlight format:
